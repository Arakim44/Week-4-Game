### about
 
This little simple game is the one of the small project from coding boot camp. This isn't really a game game. It's more like a simple clicking game where we dynamically update the HTML pages with JQuery library.

It's really simple! Each characters in the game has 3 attributes: Health points, attack points and counter attack points. Each time the player attacks, their characters attack power increases by its base attack points. For example, if the base attack point is 6, each attack will increase the attack power by 6(12,18,24, you do the math.)
When you attack the enemy characters, enmy only attack back with static counter attack power.

So go ahead, choose your character by clicking the character box, and choose your ememy by clicking the different character. Then attack by clicking the attack button.(go figure)
Your player should be able to win and lose the game no matter what character you choose. The challenge should come from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player!
